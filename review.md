# Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 5500 and HP Rechargeable Stylus Review

## Hardware

- massive device, cumbersome to fold at first -> perfect for programming and note taking on table; annoying for note taking on lap
- keyboard has to be laid on table when in tabled mode (protective cover good idea)
- convertible Chromebooks way easier to handle (at least Josie should reconsider buying one with x86_64)
- keyboard as good if not better than ThinkPad 440p's
- touchpad could be better, small adjustment would be helpful (ended up using stylus most of the time instead)
- speakers the best I've seen in a laptop
- fans quiet but noticeable, especially under load and when charging; this is not a passively cooled device like an IPad -> annoys me quiet a bit when alone without any environmental sound or music
- battery life exceptionally good (should easily handle 11-12h with my workflow)
- stylus feels very cheap for 80€; aluminum body with flimsy plastic cap for USB-C port
- stylus does job very well, one could only ask for a multi purpose button
- stylus even attaches to chassis like with an IPad (no inductive charging though)
- camera very good, only points in wrong direction
- display more reflective than ThinkPad (comparable to smartphone)
- display brightness very good indoors; colors and viewing angle stability are way better than with the ThinkPad

## General UI Appearance and Feel

- generally everything looks and feels very well made and a lot less "hacky" than expected -> Google style
- tabled mode very good for touch screen; laptop mode very good for keyboard; switch intuitive and automatic (no "just slap a touchscreen on our desktop UI" like with an MS Surface)
- stylus support is phenomenal; integrated tools do everything you'd want them to, zoom in, laser point at something, take screenshot or video of specific area
- replaced function keys (in my opinion) much better than on normal keyboard (can be set to act as classic function keys)
- Chrome has very good stylus/touchscreen/touchpad support -> I won't use Firefox
- touchpad support is way better than anything Windows or native GNU+Linux provides out-of-the-box
- streaming to ChromeCast or other supported devices (like Nvidia Shield) works perfectly
- even AppleTV streaming should work with AirParrot

## Linux

- Linux environment just works (Kitty, GIMP, C++ toolchain, Nvim(`xclip` has to be installed first), etc.); my entire workflow can live here without any compromises
- many packages are not pre-installed; when something doesn't work, there might just be a missing package
- graphical programs automatically get added to home screen after `sudo apt install`, indistinguishable from Chrome and Android apps
- links from Linux environment can directly get opened by Chrome
- all ChromeOS folders can be mounted in Linux (e.g. files can be downloaded with Chrome and accessed from Linux without having to move any files)
- network drive and usb mount is as easy as it could get (accessible from ChromeOS and Linux)
- processor speed is breathtaking and most of the time absolute overkill; I could easily replace my desktop setup with this and a second monitor (for work; gaming is a different story)
- setup a lot quicker than with Ubuntu or Fedora (no bothering with config files; it just works)

## Note Taking

- stylus works orders of magnitudes better than expected
- zero latency and perfect palm rejection with Squid -> as good as IPad
- Squid default abilities very limited; straight lines have to be bought directly or through the Pro-subscription
- Squid subscription not necessary but cheaper (all features can also directly be bought except for cloud sync)
- even GIMP works very well with stylus (almost as good as Squid if there'd be palm-rejection)
- OneNote completely unusable; line appears 1cm behind stylus
- other apps somewhere in between

## What about Google?

- a lot of Google garbage pre-installed -> keep your eyes open at initial setup
- almost all tethers to Google can be severed:
    - Google Assistant uninstalled, Google Play Store replaced or augmented with open source stores like F-Droid
- Google Assistant key, which replaced CAPS, can easily be rebound to whatever your heart desires—including escape \*\*happy VI user noises\*\*
- device unlocked with PIN or Google account password -> I created new google account just for unlocking

## Conclusion

- limits me where I don't care and leaves me do my thing where I need it to
- feels incredibly satisfying and professional to work with
- everything "just works"
- size, weight and fans sometimes quite annoying
- missing features are sensible; when something doesn't work or limits you, there probably is a very good reason for it (as opposed to Apple getting a kick out of annoying you wherever possible)
- very much worth ~500€ price point
